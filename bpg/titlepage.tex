When physicists talk about issues related to diversity or broadening participation in the field, the focus, thus far, has typically been on creating support mechanisms for women or people of color.  However, physicists who identify as LGBT+ are also a minority within the physics community and can also find themselves marginalized in certain ways.  This document aims to highlight opportunities for making the physics workplace more inclusive for LGBT+ scientists.\vspace*{\baselineskip}

Best practices for the inclusion of LGBT+ people on campus can be found in several places\footnote{W.J. Blumenfeld. 1993. \emph{Making Colleges and Universities Safe for Gay and Lesbian Students: Report and Recommendations of the Massachusetts Governors Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth}. Boston, Massachusetts.}$^,$\footnote{S. Rankin. 2003. \emph{Campus Climate for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender People: A National Perspective}. New York: National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute.}$^,$\footnote{S. Windmeyer, S. Rankin, G. Beemyn. 2009. \emph{Campus Climate Index}. On-line. Available from Internet, \href{http://www.campusclimateindex.org}{http://www.campusclimateindex.org}, accessed 12 March 2013.}. In the first portion, we limit ourselves to a set of recommendations that are particularly relevant to physicists and physics department chairs (as opposed to general university administrators). After a brief glossary of terms, we make both short-term and long-term department-level suggestions, followed by several recommendations for university-level policies that may guide conversations with institutional administrators. A list of useful external resources is available at the end of the document, along with the author list. Policies that can be implemented rapidly are flagged with stars.\vspace*{\baselineskip}
