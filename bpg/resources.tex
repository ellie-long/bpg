\end{tabular*}

The American Civil Liberties Union has joined with several other organizations to compile a very useful set of fact sheets, describing the legal situation of married same-sex couples after the US Supreme Court struck down the so-called "Defense of Marriage Act" (DOMA). This decision requires the US federal government to recognize legal same-sex marriages, but does not require individual states to do so, resulting in a confusing patchwork of protections and obligations that depend on the state where your institution is located and the state where the couple was married. The fact sheets are an educational resource for same-sex couples, students whose parents have a same-sex marriage, human resources departments, and other administrators, covering employment benefits, taxes, immigration, federal student aid, and more.
